### Overview

As the cost of college continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to navigate the complex process of choosing the right college. **We must to rethink what "need" means in our current social and economic context** because money doesn't go as far as it used to and research is emphasizing the role of social factors in college/career success. 

As a college counselor, I found that relying on ranking sites was frustrating because they never included the characteristics that I was interested in including in the ranking. To find these answers, I would have to comb through databases and try my best to spin Excel gold. Additionally, the data families need is not accessible because it requires time and data analytics experience offered through the Nashville Software School. Therefore, I decided to use my capstone as an opportunity to create a dashboard that **makes this data accessible**.

**The College Wish List aims to provide families with a more comprehensive tool for choosing the right college.** By combining the Third Way's Economic Mobility Index with additional factors such as research opportunities, program offerings, and student-faculty ratio, this project offers a more complete picture of each institution's strengths and weaknesses. The resulting tableau storyboard and calculated EMI offer a student-outcome-centered resource that is inclusive of more families who struggle to find a financially-responsible route to college for their children.

This capstone project also explores the relationship between the location of an institution and the earning potential of its graduates, as well as how socioeconomic status interacts with the location of an institution and earning potential. The resulting dashboard allows users to filter their search along these lines and also offers a reliable school recommendation system that is checked against three factors: private versus public control, endowment size, and school selectivity.

**Overall, the College Wish List offers families a more accessible and comprehensive tool for choosing the right college, taking into account not only the economic mobility of the institution but also other important factors such as cost of living, setting, retention rates, and research intensity.**

### Data Questions

1. **How will programs with high EMIs fare when additional college choice considerations are included?**
    
    The EMI is a useful starting point for understanding how well institutions improve long-term outcomes for Pell-eligible students. However, it does not give insights on any other college characteristic, such as retention and setting. It also does not give enough insight to families who are in the aid dead zone. **In this ADZ, families are ineligible for the Pell grant and any other external aid that uses a similar financial eligibility metric. At the same time, these families’ earnings are not on par with families who can foot the full bill, or at least spend money where it counts for admission.** To name a few: sustaining impressive, but expensive, extracurricular activities over years, attending private schools that are well connected to highly-selective schools, and receiving private college counselling.
    
    Overall, the impact of family income on student acceptance odds varies depending on the school and its admission policies. In general, the higher the selectivity of the school, the more likely family income will play a role in acceptance odds. For highly selective schools, which often have limited spots available, admissions committees may consider a student's ability to pay tuition when making acceptance decisions because they rely more on their endowment than government funding. Students in the ADZ are neither able to afford to pay the full tuition nor do they have the potential to receive substantial aid. **Looking at location is key here because a school’s income cutoff for aid is typically influenced by the cost of living where it is located.** By contrast, for less selective schools with larger class sizes and more spots available, family income may not be as much of a factor in acceptance odds because they often have lower tuition rates and rely more on government funding. **Since less selective schools have more flexibility in admitting students regardless of their ability to pay, these programs are also ideal when looking for a reasonable cost-after-aid outlook.**
    
    *This project forwards an already student-outcome-centered resource into one that is inclusive of more families who struggle to find a financially-responsible route to college for their children. Will schools that do well by their Pell-recipients also support their mid-income students?*
    
2. **Is there a relationship between an institution’s location on EMI?**
    
    **Recent studies show that there is a relationship between the location of an institution and the earning potential of its graduates.** This is due to various factors such as the economic conditions and job opportunities available in a particular location. In general, graduates from institutions located in urban areas tend to earn higher salaries compared to those from rural areas. This is because urban areas are usually associated with a higher cost of living and therefore employers in such areas tend to offer higher salaries to their employees. Additionally, urban areas usually have a more diverse range of job opportunities available to graduates, which can also contribute to higher earning potential. However, there are exceptions to this trend. Graduates from institutions located in rural areas may have higher earning potential in certain fields such as agriculture, natural resources, and environmental sciences. This is because these fields are more prevalent in rural areas and require specialized skills that are in high demand.
    
    *This project explores how socioeconomic status interact with the location of an institution and earning potential. The EMI’s across levels will shape our understanding of this issue.*
    

### Where the Money Resides: Factors Shaping Financial Aid Policies and Decisions

There are a myriad considerations when thinking about financial aid, making it challenging to give general advice. I sought out themes in the data that suggested how families could target schools based on:

1. Initial Aid Potential: Which schools are generally awarding higher aid to students regardless of income?
2. Aid Appeal Potential: Which schools are most likely to respond generously to financial aid appeal letters?

**Understanding trends in aid policies and practices allows us to double-check that the dashboard is generating reliable results.**

**How much do the college accrediting bodies influence school-level income policies? Not much.**

When it comes to college accreditation in the United States, there are seven regional accreditors that oversee different parts of the country. These accreditors are:

1. Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)
2. New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE)
3. Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
4. Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)
5. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)
6. WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)
7. Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC)

These entities do not offer broad-sweeping policies around financial aid cutoff and allocation outside of regulating ethics and offering best practices. Therefore, it is safe to assume that schools are using other factors to design their financial aid policies.

**So, how will we know the school recommendations are reliable? We’ll check it against three factors.**

Control: Private versus Public

According to a 2020 report by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), private colleges and universities offered an average of $19,980 in institutional aid per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student in the 2019-2020 academic year. Alternatively, public colleges and universities offered an average of $4,510 in institutional aid per FTE undergraduate student in the same year. This data suggests that **private schools generally offer more aid than public schools**. However, private schools typically have a higher sticker price. Therefore, this project uses the average cost of attendance after aid to assess how giving schools are.

Endowment Size

Additionally, a study by the College Board found that colleges and universities with larger endowments were able to offer more financial aid to students. **Schools with endowments over $1 billion were able to offer an average of $60,000 in financial aid per student**, while schools with endowments under $100 million were only able to offer an average of $9,000 in financial aid per student. This indicates that larger endowments are associated with higher amounts of financial aid offered to students. This fact is particularly important when looking at families earning over $30,000 because external scholarships, federal aid, and some internal awards have similar low-income/high-need cutoff points; non-Pell students are going to rely primarily on internal awards when their expected family contribution is not enough to foot the bill. The endowment factor is also important to the financial aid appeal process.

School Selectivity

The schools in this pool are the ones we hear about most often: Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst College, etc. A 2018 report by Inside Higher Ed found that **more selective colleges and universities tend to offer more financial aid to attract high-achieving students**. These schools are competing with other highly selective institutions for the same pool of talented students and need to offer competitive financial aid packages to outbid other programs. There is at least one other aspect of selectivity that families can consider: program selectivity. Within schools there are also special programs that have special funding pools and/or are selective enough to warrant bidding, such as honors colleges and pre-medical programs.

### Money Still Can’t Buy Happiness

Regardless of how much aid schools offer, families still contend with non-financial considerations to truly understand the value of a package:

- The **cost of living** being high around the school can make it difficult for the student to afford housing, food, and generally enjoy themselves.
- **Settings** not only inform the cost of living but also affect other important considerations, such as the opportunities throughout the school year and ease of travelling home during break.
- **High retention rates** after the first year can be a strong indicator of a university's ability to provide academic and social support to its students.
- **Research intensity** can provide opportunities for students to participate in research and gain valuable experience in their field of study. This can lead to increased job prospects after graduation and stronger graduate program applications.

The dashboard will offer the user the opportunity to filter along these lines.

### Further Work & Challenges

- **Disentangling the EMI score calculations for the other income levels, as each level has different factors and considerations.** This may require additional research into the specific factors that contribute to the EMI score for each income level.
- **Acquiring data on schools that do not report, in order to create a larger dataset.** This could involve reaching out to these schools directly or using other data sources to supplement the existing dataset.
- **Fairly representing community colleges and the boost they offer students.** This revamp could mean creating a separate tool for identifying resources at different community colleges, such as scholarships and transfer programs.

### Data Sources

The data used in this project can be found at the following sites:

[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/) is a framework for categorizing colleges and universities in the United States. It is based on factors such as the types of degrees offered, research activity, and level of student enrollment. 

[Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?gotoReportId=7&) is a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

[Third Way Out](https://thirdway.imgix.net/downloads/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-rating-higher-ed-by-economic-mobility/EMI_Data.xlsx) is a rating system for institutions of higher education based on their ability to promote economic mobility for their graduates. The rating system takes into account factors such as graduation rates, salaries of graduates, and the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants. This information is used to determine a "mobility score" for each institution, which is then used to rank colleges and universities.

[Social Mobility Index](https://www.socialmobilityindex.org/Social%20Mobility%20Index%202022%20-%20College%20Rankings%20by%20CollegeNET.pdf) is a college ranking system that measures the extent to which colleges and universities promote upward social mobility for their students. The ranking system takes into account factors such as graduation rates, salaries of graduates, and the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants. The colleges and universities are ranked based on their overall social mobility score. The higher the score, the better the institution is at promoting social mobility for its students.

| setting | From IPEDS: Locale codes identify the geographic status of a school on an urban continuum ranging from “large city” to “rural.” They are based on a school’s physical address. The urban-centric locale codes introduced in this file are assigned through a methodology developed by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Division in 2005. The urban-centric locale codes apply current geographic concepts to the original NCES locale codes used on IPEDS files through 2004. —    11 = City: Large: Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more. — 12 = City: Midsize: Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000. — 13 = City: Small: Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 100,000. — 21 = Suburb: Large: Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population of 250,000 or more. — 22 = Suburb: Midsize: Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000. — 23 = Suburb: Small: Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population less than 100,000. — 31 = Town: Fringe: Territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area. — 32 = Town: Distant: Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area. — 33 = Town: Remote: Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles of an urbanized area. — 41 - Rural: Fringe: Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster. — 42 = Rural: Distant: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster. — 43 = Rural: Remote: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster. — American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, were not assigned a locale code because the geographic and governmental structures of these entities do not fit the definitional scheme used to derive the code. |
| c21basic | From IPEDS: The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in the early 1970s to support its research program. The Basic Classification was originally published for public use in 1973, and subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018 and 2021. The 2021 update includes only minor changes. Specifically, the label “Tribal Colleges” has been changed back?to “Tribal Colleges and Universities”. In addition, there is a newly created category “Special Focus Research?Institution”, comprised of the special focus?institutions?that meet the criteria for being considered a “Research University” but confer degrees in a limited range of academic programs. Additionally, the special focus categories of “Engineering Schools” and “Other Technology-Related Schools” have been combined into a single category. Classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on 2019-20 data. For the full definition and methodology go to https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/classification_descriptions/basic.php — Doctoral universities - Includes institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees during the update year and also institutions with below 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees that awarded at least 30 professional practice doctoral degrees in at least 2 programs. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges. — The first two categories include only institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees and had at least $5 million in total research expenditures (as reported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Higher Education Research & Development Survey (HERD)). — R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity — R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity — D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities — Master's Colleges and Universities - Generally includes institutions that awarded at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year (with occasional exceptions – see Methodology). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges. — Baccalaureate Colleges - Includes institutions where baccalaureate or higher degrees represent at least 50 percent of all degrees but where fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees were awarded during the update year. (Some institutions above the master's degree threshold are also included; see Methodology.) Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges. — Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges - Includes four-year colleges (by virtue of having at least one baccalaureate degree program) that conferred more than 50 percent of degrees at the associate's level. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges. — Associate's Colleges - Institutions at which the highest level degree awarded is an associate's degree. The institutions are sorted into nine categories based on the intersection of two factors: disciplinary focus (transfer, career & technical or mixed) and dominant student type (traditional, nontraditional or mixed). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges. — Special Focus Institutions- Institutions where a high concentration of degrees is in a single field or set of related fields. Excludes Tribal Colleges. — Tribal Colleges - Colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, as identified in IPEDS Institutional Characteristics. — Classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on 2016-17 data. — The methodology can be found at http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/definitions.php. |
| c21ipug | From IPEDS: The Undergraduate Instructional Program Classification focuses attention on undergraduate education, regardless of the presence or extent of graduate education. Undergraduate education is an essential component of what most colleges and universities do, as the vast majority of U.S. institutions of higher education teach undergraduates. Indeed, even at institutions with strong commitments to graduate education and the production of new knowledge through research and scholarship, the undergraduate program usually accounts for the majority of student enrollment. For the full definition and methodology, go to https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/classification_descriptions/ugrad_program.php — Classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on 2019-20 data. — Associate's Colleges, High Transfer - Awarded associate's degrees but no bachelor's degrees with fewer than 30% of awards (degrees and certificates) in career & technical programs. — Associate's Colleges, Mixed Transfer/Career & Technical - Awarded associate's degrees but no bachelor's degrees with 30-49% of awards (degrees and certificates) in career & technical programs. — Associate's Colleges, High Career & Technical - Awarded associate's degrees but no bachelor's degrees with more than 50% of awards (degrees and certificates) in career & technical programs. — Special Focus Two-Year Institutions - Awarded associate's degrees but no bachelor's degrees with typically more than 75% of awards in a single career & technical program. — Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges - Awarded both associate's and bachelor's degrees, but the majority of degrees awarded were at the associate's level. — Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in up to half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Arts & sciences plus professions, no graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in up to half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Balanced arts & sciences/professions, no graduate coexistence - Bachelor's degrees awarded were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 % in each), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence -Bachelor's degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 % in each), and graduate degrees were observed in up to half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence - Bachelor's degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 % in each), and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions plus arts & sciences, no graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health, and social work), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in up to half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions plus arts & sciences, high graduate coexistence - 60–79 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions focus, no graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health, and social work), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions focus, some graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in up to half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. — Professions focus, high graduate coexistence - At least 80 % of bachelor's degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors. |
